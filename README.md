# DayNeZ

DayNeZ is a wave-based zombie survival game written in 6502 Assembler for the NES. DayNeZ is inspired by DayZ in so far as it has zombies that you shoot. This project was part of one of my modules at Falmouth University that spanned 3 months. Learning 6502 was a particular challenge as it was the first time I wrote in a programming language where the main focus was not on OOP. I found programming in assembler difficult at first but as my understanding deepened so to did my enjoyment of working so close to the metal.
